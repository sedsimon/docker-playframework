A dockerized play framework development environment which uses Vagrant's Docker provider to host containers.

To Use:
* install Vagrant and Virtualbox
* clone repo and vagrant up
* 'd.activator new' will create a new play application using typesafe activator. Do this in the /vagrant directory so that files are accessible to the host machine
* cd to the directory of a play project and run 'd.activator' to start it
